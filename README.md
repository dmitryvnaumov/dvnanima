# dvnanima

**dvnanima** is a collection of physics-driven animation scripts built with **Manim**.

This repository contains reusable patterns and complete scenes for
visualizing various concepts from modern physics. 

---

## What this is

- Carefully designed **scientific animations**, not decorative graphics  
- Code written for **clarity, reuse, and extension**
- A toolkit grown out of real lectures, courses, and research outreach

If you teach physics, prepare talks, or build science visualizations —
this repository is meant to save you time.
